# Status

Updated at the end of every session. Keep it to what the next session needs; history is in git.

- **Phase:** 2 (debug tool) done 2026-10-30; next is phase 3 (identity build). No build yet.
- **Done (phase 2):** `tools/debug/warp.py` + `warp.lua` + `scenes.lua`: cold boot -> any scene, proof shot
  `work/qa/warp/<scene>/scene.png`, state `work/states/<scene>.sstate`; `--all` regenerates every state, `map:<id>:x:y`
  reaches any of the 560 maps. Scenes: title + load screen, village/house/2nd town/overworld/dungeon, field menu and
  all 7 submenus, 3 shops (buy lists), NPC talk, random battle, events 0-4/7-17 (intro-free: baths, ATOK, AMAP,
  card album, END00, staff roll start + last page, END01 epilogue, PT00), minigames 0/2-6. RAM map, main-loop states,
  file loader and map tables in `docs/re/debug.md`. `tools/debug/fileload.lua` logs every disc file load (--debugger).
  Confirmed: the game loads files through MMPS_CD.SFS (phase 3 must rewrite it).
- **Next (phase 3):** identity build: unpack/repack with mkpsxiso (`work/disc/layout.xml`), PAC repack, rebuild
  MMPS_CD.SFS from the new LBAs/sizes; byte-identical test. Then `tools/build.py` + smoke.
- **Later notes:** kanji table needs reviewer pass (92 duplicate OCR values; known misreads in docs/re/text.md) before
  phase 4 jp text is final. SMAP16.PAC:37 string table doesn't decode with the simple rule. PCSX-Redux nightly
  `GPU.getVRAM()` returns 2 MB (1024 rows): read the first 512 rows.
  Debug-tool gaps (add when a phase needs them): event 5 (EVT069) and minigame 1 (YUMI1 other entry) stay black
  from a plain warp (need their calling script's context); no fixed-enemy-group battle yet (exec hook on
  0x8004540C a0 with --debugger); no story-flag array yet (events/NPCs that depend on progress); party is the
  New Game party (1 member, no items: `MONEY=` var exists, inventory RAM unknown); shops/NPCs found only for town 2.
  GOD uses the GameShark HP addresses (not checked per member). CR_PG01-99 not loaded by the ending (card pages?).
- **Open bugs:** none.
- **Waiting on the user:** (non-blocking) PCSX-Redux GUI keyboard input not checked by hand (no interactive session
  in one-shot runs); scripted input verified.
